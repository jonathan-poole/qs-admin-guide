# Optimize Sheet Order for Adoption <i class="fas fa-dolly-flatbed fa-xs" title="Shipped | Native Capability"></i>

## Goal
{:.no_toc}

Many times when an application is being developed there is an assumption that the sheets were properly ordered, based in a story of the application data. It is always a good practice to check the user adoption of the sheets and, reorder them to increase adoption rates and BI effectiveness.

## Operations Monitor - Analyze Aplication Sheet Adopion  <i class="fas fa-dolly-flatbed fa-xs" title="Shipped | Native Capability"></i>

It is possible to check the application's sheets usage using the Operations Monitor App.

In the Monitoring Apps stream, select **Operations Monitor**:

Inside the Operations Monitor application there is a dedicated sheet to do the sheet usage analysis:

Inside the **Sheet Usage** sheet you will be able to see all sheets across all the applications, for this example I will select an application named "Sample App":

Now we can see all the sheets (Base Sheets, Community Sheets and Private Sheets) that we have inside the "Sample App" application.

[![optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption04.png](images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption04.png)](https://github.com/qs-admin-guide/qs-admin-guide/blob/master/docs/asset_management/apps/images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption04.png)

You can notice that the usage order would be:

Order | Sheet Name
------|--------------------------------
1     | Dashboard
2     | Inventory
2     | Sales Analysis by Region
3     | Expansion Analysis
4     | DSO

-------------------------

## Reorder Application Sheet

If we open the published "Sample App" application we can see that the original order do not correspod with the usage.

[![optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption05.png](images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption05.png)](https://github.com/qs-admin-guide/qs-admin-guide/blob/master/docs/asset_management/apps/images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption05.png)

To change that order by defaut the application owner should clone the "Sample App".

[![optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption06.png](images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption06.png)](https://github.com/qs-admin-guide/qs-admin-guide/blob/master/docs/asset_management/apps/images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption06.png)

As soon as the application gets duplicated it will be at Personal > Work area. Now we can edit the Base Sheets order.

[![optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption07.png](images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption07.png)](https://github.com/qs-admin-guide/qs-admin-guide/blob/master/docs/asset_management/apps/images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption07.png)

As soon as the application is open, make sure that the "Touch screen mode" feature is turned off.

[![optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption08.png](images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption08.png)](https://github.com/qs-admin-guide/qs-admin-guide/blob/master/docs/asset_management/apps/images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption08.png)

To move sheets we just need to drag and drop them to the desired order. In this case I will make sheet "Sales Analytis by Region" the second sheet.

[![optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption09.png](images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption09.png)](https://github.com/qs-admin-guide/qs-admin-guide/blob/master/docs/asset_management/apps/images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption09.png)

And the "Inventory" sheet the third sheet.

[![optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption10.png](images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption10.png)](https://github.com/qs-admin-guide/qs-admin-guide/blob/master/docs/asset_management/apps/images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption10.png)

Now the application sheet order is compliant with the usage data.

[![optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption11.png](images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption11.png)](https://github.com/qs-admin-guide/qs-admin-guide/blob/master/docs/asset_management/apps/images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption11.png)

The "Sample App" now should be republished, replacing the old version.
